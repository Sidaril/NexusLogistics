## Versioning and Changelog

After every feature implementation or bug fix, you **must** perform the following steps before submitting your changes:

1.  **Increment the version number** in the following files:
    * `NexusLogistics.cs`
    * `Properties/AssemblyInfo.cs`
    * `README.md`
2.  **Add a new entry to the changelog** in `README.md`. The entry should clearly and concisely describe the changes you made.
3.  **Build the solution** to ensure there are no compilation errors and the code builds successfully.
